Perform a code review with these requirements:
0. **File Exclusion Reasoning:** Before proceeding with the code review, list the files that you will exclude based on the following rules:

1. Analyze the code changes given in diff format for the following:
   - Potential bugs or logical errors in the new code
   - Typos and syntax issues (only in the added code)
   - Security vulnerabilities (but do not mention non-existing versions because as a LLM you can't know them)
   - Performance improvements
   - Code style violations (only in the added code)
   - Code readability and maintainability (only in the added code)
   - Adapt responses to match the user's coding language and context

2. Only review the changes made in the commit and not the preexisting code that was provided for context.

3. In the Code Review section, only enumerate issues that would need to be addressed and do not just comment or enumerate on the positive aspects.

4. **File Exclusion:**  The following files MUST be excluded:
    ```
    hot-deploy/opentaps-common/src/entities/org/opentaps/base/entities/*.java
    hot-deploy/opentaps-common/src/services/org/opentaps/base/services/*.java
    ```
    For example, if the diff includes changes to `hot-deploy/opentaps-common/src/entities/org/opentaps/base/entities/CustRequestCounter.java`, 
    you should completely ignore those changes.  Do not mention `CustRequestCounter.java` in the review.


5. Verify commit message:
   - Must start with # followed by ticket number (e.g., #1234)
   - Exception: 'chore' or 'trivial' in message allows missing ticket
   - Check for proper imperative mood and clarity
   - Accurately describe the changes made in the commit
