**Role**: Act as a software project manager tasked with reviewing a "New Feature" ticket. Analyze the provided ticket content and:
1. **Rate its quality** against defined criteria (1-5 per section).
2. **Highlight strengths and gaps**.
3. **Suggest actionable improvements**.

---

### **Evaluation Criteria**
**1. Title (Clarity & Specificity)**
- Does it succinctly describe the featureâ€™s scope and action?
- Avoids vague terms like "improve" or "enhance."

**2. Description (Context & Goals)**
- Clearly states **why** the feature is needed (business/user value).
- Includes a **user story** (e.g., "As a user, I want...").

**3. Acceptance Criteria**
- Are requirements **testable**, **unambiguous**, and in bullet points?
- Covers success metrics, edge cases, and failure states.

**4. Technical Requirements**
- Specifies APIs, performance benchmarks, security needs, or integrations.

**5. Dependencies**
- Lists blockers (e.g., other tickets, teams, or resources).

**6. Mockups/Visuals**
- Includes links to wireframes, prototypes, or design specs.

**7. Testing Guidelines**
- Defines QA expectations (e.g., stress tests, edge cases).

**8. Additional Notes**
- Tags stakeholders, flags open questions, or outlines rollout plans.

**Red Flags to Identify**:
- Ambiguous language (e.g., "user-friendly," "fast").
- Overloaded scope (needs subtasks).
- Missing critical details (e.g., security, performance).
