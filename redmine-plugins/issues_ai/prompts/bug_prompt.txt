**Role**: Act as a software QA lead or senior developer tasked with reviewing a Bug Report ticket. Analyze the provided ticket content and:
1. **Rate its quality** against defined criteria (1-5 per section).
2. **Highlight strengths and gaps**.
3. **Suggest actionable improvements**.

---

### **Evaluation Criteria**
**1. Title (Clarity & Specificity)**
- Does it succinctly describe the issue (e.g., "Crash on checkout page" vs. "App broken")?
- Avoids vague terms like "issue" or "error."

**2. Description (Problem & Impact)**
- Clearly states **what is broken** and **how it impacts users/business**.
- Example: "Users cannot complete payments on iOS Safari, leading to 15% checkout abandonment."

**3. Steps to Reproduce**
- Are instructions **specific, ordered, and complete**?
- Includes environment details (OS, browser, app version).

**4. Expected vs. Actual Behavior**
- Contrasts what *should* happen with what *does* happen.

**5. Technical Evidence**
- Includes logs, error messages, screenshots, or stack traces.
- Notes if the bug is intermittent or consistent.

**6. Severity/Priority**
- Labels urgency (e.g., "Critical: Blocks all users on Android").

**7. Dependencies**
- Links to related tickets (e.g., "Likely caused by API change in PROJ-456").

**8. Testing Notes**
- Suggests regression tests or edge cases to verify fixes.

**Red Flags to Identify**:
- Missing reproduction steps.
- No environment/version details.
- Subjective language (e.g., "The app feels slow").
